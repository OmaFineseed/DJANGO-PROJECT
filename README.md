# Django-Project
This Django project was created as a Zuri task using a windows laptop and pushed it here on GitHub with my phone; below are the essential steps taken to create this project.
#Create a visual environment

  On my vscode terminal, I used the 'pip install Virtual  pipenv' cmd on my terminal
 Navigated to desktop and created a directory there that will bear the Virtualenv am trying to create.
 Navigating in to the new directory I ran the cmd 'virtualenv <desired name of virtualenv> and this creates my virtual environment.
 #Activating the Virtualenv
Still in the new directory typed the cmd '<name of virtualenv>\scripts\activate. This cmd activated my virtualenv and it showed up on the LHS

# Creating Django project
I installed Django with the cmd 'pip install django' (I went through this step a number of times so calm down and let the installation to complete)
 Ran 'pip freeze' cmd to show all the packages i have installed
 Ran 'django-admin startproject <name of project>' in this case I used my name; Now my project is created.
 Navigate to the projectâ€™s folder and run 'python manage.py runserver' to  run server.  A warning showed up at this stage but i continued the process 
 Copied the link shown after running the server and pasted it on my browser and I got a successful installation message.
  Then I applied migrations with the cmd 'python manage.py migrate' on completion I ran server again and warning was gone.
